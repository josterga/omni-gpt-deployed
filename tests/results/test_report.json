        "actual_response": "To reference period over period fields in a drill query, you can follow these steps based on the official documentation:\n\n1. **Select the Date Dimension**: Start by using the field picker to select the date dimension you want to analyze. You can do this by selecting \u201cPeriod over Period\u201d from the three-dot menu associated with the desired date dimension.\n\n2. **Choose Time Periods**: After selecting the date dimension, two dropdowns will appear above the results pane. In the first dropdown, select the current period you want to analyze, and in the second dropdown, choose the period you want to compare it against. The options for comparison will default to relevant time frames, but you can customize these as needed.\n\n3. **Drill Queries Setup**: In your drill queries, you can specify the fields you want to include in the drill down. For example, you can create a drill query that references the period over period fields by including them in the `fields` array of your drill query configuration. \n\nHere\u2019s a simplified example of how you might set up a drill query in YAML format:\n\n```yaml\nmy_period_over_period_measure:\n  sql: ${your_measure_field}\n  aggregate_type: sum\n  drill_queries:\n    Period Comparison Drill:\n      fields: \n        [\n        period_over_period_field_1,\n        period_over_period_field_2,\n        ...\n        ]\n      base_view: your_base_view_name\n      limit: 10\n```\n\nThis structure allows you to drill down into the specific period over period fields you are interested in.\n\n**Source**: The information is derived from the official documentation under the sections about \"Period-over-period analysis\" and \"drill_queries\" (DOCS).",

        "actual_response": "To set up customers who have users in multiple regions, including the EU, the following recommendations are based on the official documentation:\n\n1. **Multiple Organization Accounts**: Each Omni organization account is hosted in a single region. Therefore, if your customers have users in multiple regions, you will need to maintain an Omni organization account in each region where your users are located. This means you will need separate accounts for the EU, as well as any other regions (e.g., United States, Canada, Australia) where your users are based (Source: DOCS, \"Supported cloud regions\").\n\n2. **Data Storage and Processing**: Customer content will be stored and processed in the region you choose for each organization account. This is crucial for compliance with regional data protection regulations, especially for users in the EU (Source: DOCS, \"Supported cloud regions\").\n\n3. **Data Security Considerations**: When dealing with multi-tenant customer data, consider implementing security strategies such as:\n   - **Row Level Security**: This allows you to assign user attributes and control access based on those attributes.\n   - **Schema Level Security**: If each client is in a separate schema, you can utilize dynamic schemas.\n   - **Database Level Security**: If each client is in a separate database, dynamic database environments can be leveraged (Source: DOCS, \"Data security best practices\").\n\n4. **Compliance and Support**: Ensure that your settings comply with regional regulations. For instance, you can limit logins from Omni support to a specific region, which is important for maintaining compliance with data protection laws (Source: DOCS, \"Organization settings\").\n\nIn summary, to effectively set up customers with users in multiple regions, including the EU, you should create separate organization accounts for each region, ensure proper data security measures are in place, and maintain compliance with regional regulations.",

For example, if you have a topic called `west_coast_transactions`, you would begin with that.\n\n2. **Specify the Base View**: You need to indicate the base view that the topic is built upon. This is typically done using the `base_view` parameter.\n\n3. **Add Default Filters**: Under the topic definition, you can specify the `default_filters` parameter. This parameter allows you to set default filtering conditions for the fields you want to filter on. The fields should be fully scoped if they exist outside the current view.\n\nHere\u2019s an example configuration:\n\n```yaml\nwest_coast_transactions:\n  base_view: order_items\n  default_filters:\n    users.state:\n      is: [California, Oregon, Washington]\n    users.country:\n      not: null\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The topic `west_coast_transactions` is based on the `order_items` view.\n- The `default_filters` are set to filter for users in the states of California, Oregon, and Washington, and to ensure that the country field is not null.\n\n### Important Notes:\n- Ensure that the fields you are filtering on are correctly scoped to avoid errors.\n- If you encounter issues with filters not being recognized, check that the fields exist in the context of the topic you are defining.\n\nThis information is derived from the official documentation on filters and model file parameters, specifically regarding how to structure `default_filters` for topics (Source: DOCS, Title: Filters).",

        "actual_response": "**Query Models in Omni Analytics**\n\nQuery models, also referred to as query fields, are specific to individual queries within Omni Analytics and do not impact the global data model or the behavior of fields in other workbooks or queries. They allow users to create custom fields that can be tailored for specific queries without altering the underlying data model. \n\nWhen you edit SQL in the Advanced Editor, Omni attempts to parse the SQL. If the resulting SQL includes fields that do not match those in the workbook or shared model, Omni creates query fields that are unique to that particular query. These fields can have user-friendly names if aliases are provided in the SQL query, which may appear as 'Custom Field 0' or similar (Source: DOCS, \"Writing SQL in Omni\").\n\nOnce you have finished editing SQL in the Advanced Editor, you have the option to either promote those query fields to the workbook model or save the query as a view (known as a query view). Best practices suggest working out of a SQL tab to avoid generating unnecessary query fields (Source: DOCS, \"Writing SQL in Omni\").\n\n**Query Views**\n\nQuery views are essentially saved workbook queries that can be reused. They are stored in the model with a specific file name structure and can be promoted to a shared model for use in other workbooks. This allows for greater flexibility and reuse of query logic across different analyses (Source: DOCS, \"Query views\").\n\nIn summary, query models are a way to create and manage custom fields for specific queries in Omni Analytics, while query views allow users to save and reuse these queries across different workbooks. This functionality enhances the analytical capabilities within Omni by providing a structured approach to managing SQL queries and their outputs.",

According to discussions in Slack, if you create a topic that includes multiple tables, and one of those tables contains the field you want to filter by (e.g., \"Project Name\"), you can add that as a dashboard filter. This filter can then be applied to any charts built off that topic, as long as there is a join relationship between the table containing the filter field and the other tables.\n\nAdditionally, if \"Project Name\" exists in multiple tables, you can specify which project name filters each specific chart by mapping filters to different fields for each dashboard tile. This allows for flexibility in how filters are applied across various data sources and charts.\n\nThis information is derived from Slack conversations, specifically from user discussions in the #omni-scaleai channel (messages from U022LMM6SHG and U07H20ZD6Q7).\n\nFor further details on how to implement this, you can refer to the official documentation on mapping filters to different fields for dashboard tiles, which provides guidance on setting up filters effectively across multiple data sources.",

Here\u2019s how to do it using both methods:\n\n### Method 1: Using Google Apps Script\n1. **Set Up Your Environment**:\n   - Ensure you have an Omni dashboard with a tile configured for export.\n   - Have a Google account and an existing Google Sheet ready.\n\n2. **Create a Google Apps Script**:\n   - Go to [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com/home/projects/create) and create a new project.\n   - Rename the project and the script file.\n   - Paste the provided Apps Script template into the script file and save it.\n\n3. **Deploy the Script**:\n   - In the configuration menu, set **Execute as = Me** and **Who has access = Anyone**.\n   - Click **Deploy**, then authorize access when prompted.\n   - After successful deployment, copy the Web app URL.\n\n4. **Configure Omni**:\n   - Open your Omni dashboard and create a new delivery.\n   - In the delivery **Send** menu, select the query you want to send to your Google Sheet.\n   - Use the copied Web app URL to complete the setup (specific steps for this part may be detailed in the script template).\n\nThis method allows you to catch webhook deliveries from Omni and export data to Google Sheets, creating a new tab each time the script runs (Source: DOCS - Sending Omni webhook deliveries to Google Apps Script).\n\n### Method 2: Using Zapier\n1. **Requirements**:\n   - An Omni dashboard with a tile configured for export.\n   - A Zapier account (note that some features may require a Pro plan).\n   - An existing Google Sheet.\n\n2. **Set Up Zapier**:\n   - Create a new Zap in Zapier that catches a webhook from Omni.\n   - Configure the Zap to send the data to Google Sheets. You will need to set up the action to add rows or update the sheet based on the data received from Omni.\n\nThis method is useful for automating the process without needing to write any code, but it does require familiarity with Zapier's interface (Source: DOCS - Sending Omni webhook deliveries to Zapier).\n\n### Summary\nYou can choose either Google Apps Script for a more customizable approach or Zapier for a no-code solution to share your Omni dashboard data with Google Sheets. Both methods require an Omni dashboard set up for export and an existing Google Sheet.",

This allows you to filter the results based on a subset defined in another query.\n4. **Select the Tab and Dimension**: You will then need to choose the specific tab and dimension that you wish to filter by.\n\nThis process effectively creates a dynamic subset of information that can help you analyze the data more deeply. The filtering will generate SQL `WHERE` clauses that look like `WHERE IN (SELECT...)`, which is useful for refining your analysis (Source: DOCS, \"Querying data\").\n\nAdditionally, if you want to flatten the pivot and create filtered measures, you can do so by clicking the **actions menu** (three dots) on a column and selecting **Flatten pivot**. This will allow you to create measures for the pivoted dimension, and you can also choose to create an \"Other\" bucket for values not included in the flattened measures (Source: DOCS, \"Custom Fields\").\n\nThese steps should help you effectively filter on a dimension that you are pivoting on in Omni Analytics.
